    <h4>What is Css ?</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Css stands for cascading style sheets.</li><br>
        <li> Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
            paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li> <span class="demo" >Css is not necceary</span> <span class="demo2">Csssaves a lot pf worke.</span>
            ir can cantrol the layout of multiple 
            web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li class="sumit">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files </li><br>

    </ol>

    <h4>CSS can be added to HTML decuments in 3 ways:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style Element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an extarnal CSS file.</li>
        <li >The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS file.however <b class="jyoti">in this <br>  
             tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b>because this i easier to demonstrate,
            and easier for you to try it yourelf.</li>


    </ul>

    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.id,
        on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.
        ID is also spacial in that you can use a special URL to
         link directly to an element and its used bt javascript.</p>
     
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a spacific element on a web page.
        once an element has been targeted,a 
        style can be applied to the element. </p>
    
    <p>There is a wide rang of selectors available.two of the most commonly used are class and ID .
        both are uesd to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
